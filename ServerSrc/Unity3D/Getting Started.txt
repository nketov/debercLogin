Getting started
===============

The Unity3D client supports all the PlayerIO tools and services and 
works in all Unity3D enviroments: App, Web, iOS etc.

YahooGamesNetwork.unitpackage can be used to import PlayerIOClient.iOS.a (for iOS), PlayerIOClient.Android.jar (for android), and 
PlayerIOUnity3DClient.dll to your "Plugins" folder under the "Assets" folder of your Unity project.

iOS:
     The PlayerIOClient.iOS.a lib is dependent on the MessageUI.framework. The MessageUI.framework needs to be added to the 
xcode project produced by unity. You can do this by selecting your target in xcode, selecting the "Build Phases" tab and then
adding MessageUI.framework to "Link Binary with Libraries".

Examples:

* Example - Multiplayer - Mushrooms
  Read the "Getting Started.txt" file in the 
  "Example - Multiplayer - Mushrooms" folder
