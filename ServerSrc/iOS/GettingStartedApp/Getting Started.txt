===== Getting Started =====

1. Download the Develpement Package from https://playerio.com/download
2. Unarchive the package
3. Under the "Build Phases" expand the "Link Binary With Libraries" and add the PlayerIOClient.framework which can be found under the iOS folder.
4. You would also need to add: 
	MessageUI.framework
	SystemConfiguration.framework
	AdSupport.framework
since they are dependencies for PlayerIOClient.framework
5. You can now import PlayerIOClient/PlayerIO.h classes as follows:
#import <PlayerIOClient/PlayerIO.h>
